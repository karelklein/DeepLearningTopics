    "### Where does it come from? Who are its ancestors?\n",
    "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were first introduced to the public in June of 2014.  Ian Goodfellow and his team at University of Montreal were working on a new approach to generative models, and what started as an interesting idea Goodfellow had at a bar resulted in a seminal paper that would leave much of the machine learning community in some mode of astonishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what GANs are and what they do, it is useful to know what a Generative Model is. A generative model is a unsupervised learning technique which takes a sequence of input samples and attempts to predict the most likely outcome given that input.  An example is the word prediction feature on modern smart phones. Given a set of words typed by the user, the model will predict a a word most likely to be the user’s next choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic process of a generative model can be seen as one that takes in a random seed from some distribution and transforms it into an output that looks and feels like a sample from the real data. These models were historically popular in realms like classical statistics and statistical physics, where one application included modeling phase transitions in thermodynamics. During the 1980’s and 90’s, these models began making their way to machine learning and neuroscience, leading to new developments in generative-style neural nets such as as variational and denoising autoencoders."

    "### What do they do differently, and how?\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs apply this baseline concept to a neural network architecture to achieve results superior to the traditional neural networks. The GAN framework implements two nets with adversarial roles. The first net, called the Generator (G), creates ‘fake’ samples that resemble the true data, while the Discriminator (D) is fed both samples from the real dataset and ‘fake’ ones from the generator. The discriminator’s chief task is then to distinguish if the sample is from the real set or if it is ‘fake’. With its guess in place, D is rewarded if it makes a correct prediction. Running this process iteratively, D is rewarded with the total number of correct predictions it makes, while G is rewarded every time D makes a mistake.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this intuitively, the classic analogy of counterfeiters comes to mind: counterfeiters have made some false currency and would like to convince the authorities that, indeed, their cash is legitimate.  The investigators’ mission is then to distinguish real cash from forged, and to punish the counterfeiters accordingly."

    "Lets look a slightly deeper into this novel framework.  Let Preal and Psynth be the distribution over real data and synthetic data, respectively.  The discriminator D can be trained such that it maps inputs, such as images, to numbers in the range [0,1] and attempts to discern which distribution the image came from. Then,  its expected output Ex[D(x)] is as high as possible when x is a member of Preal and as low as possible when it is a member of Psynth. Now we can use the training data to train D using backpropagation. Once D has been trained, the adversaries may begin their game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the generator G is to create instances z in Psynth such that Ex[D(z)] is as high as possible in order to fool D into believing they are real.  Once these base goals have been laid out, the training of G begins.  On each ‘move’, D will take a samples from both P distributions and improve its capability to differentiate between. Meanwhile, G produces some instances from its forgery plant and updates its parameters so that the expected discriminator output (given G’s samples) increases slightly. This training continues until the expected output on instances from Preal and Psynth become equal. That is, when G has trained enough so that its generated fakes samples can no longer be differentiated from the real data by the discriminator.  Returning to the analogy, the game stops when the forger prevails."

Researchers at Facebook AI experimented with a bedroom image dataset by removing the representation of windows from all images. What they found was that the GAN was able to replace this space in the bedroom with objects such as televisions and doors. This insight corroborates the idea that the network is able to differentiate representations of scenes from those of objects.\n",

In one experiment, arithmetic applied to face images reveals the various relationships that a GAN is able to capture."

    "The results are of noticeably higher quality than those produced by the conventional neural network. The images predicted are crisp, contain well defined edges, and are immediately recognizable as ‘real’ to the unsuspecting observer.  Without ever being briefed on the laws of motion or the physical properties of the context, the adversarial network recognizes patterns from its training data and is able to generate realistic scenes as predictions.  With continued improvements, we could see GANs completely change what is possible in the realms of video scene enhancement, text-to-image synthesis, generative visual manipulation, and countless others."

    "We have seen the potential for GANs in producing realistic images. However, open questions remain about an appropriate metric with which to assess the GAN's results. In the case of images, the results are easy to intuit and compare. In other settings, such as text analysis, the results produced by these networks are more difficult to describe and to compare. In future work, we will likely see developments addressing this difficulty and applications whose beginnings we have only gotten a glimpse of."
