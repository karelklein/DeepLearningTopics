# Deep Learning Topics
Projects involving deep learning approaches to image classification, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, image reconstruction, and other experiments.

## Contents
- DeepLearning
	- Built a recommender system by computing similarity matrix and applying it to 100k movielens dataset.
	- Trained a convolutional autoencoder to reconstruct handwritten digits form the MNIST dataset.
	- Used autoencoder, Singular Value Decomposition, and RGB histograms to create an image classification system.
- GAN experiment
	- Application of Generative Adversarial Networks for creation of handwritten digit images
- LSTM Language Detection
	- Utilize a LSTM network to predict probabilites of strings. Probabilities are then used in a scoring metric to classify a string as either an English or a French word.
- Topic Modeling
	- Applied LDA topic modeling and Google's Word2Vec to conduct a classification experiment for IMDB movie reviews.
- Sentiment Analysis
	- Mining of 25k IMDB movie reviews to train a SVM sentiment classifier. Achieved accuracy of 80% on Kaggle test set.
